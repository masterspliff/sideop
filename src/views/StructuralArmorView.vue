      <h1>Structural Armor: Strong, Resilient, and Designed to Withstand the Toughest Conditions</h1>
      <p>In the face of threats and extreme structural loads, Structural Armor provides steadfast protection. These armor solutions are ingeniously designed to withstand structural loadings while also resisting hostile actions. This dual capability empowers designers to utilize these armor panels as integral construction elements in vehicles, shelters, and buildings, reinforcing their structural integrity without compromising on safety.</p>
  
      <p>Composhield has established a reputation for innovation in this field, maintaining three types of structural armor technologies, each tailor-made to meet specific application areas: non-mobile, semi-mobile, and mobile.</p>

      <h2>Non-Mobile: Resilient Structures with HIRC</h2>
      <p>Non-Mobile applications involve permanent structures such as embassies, military headquarters, and power plants that are often primary targets for hostile actions. The predominant threat for these installations is large explosive charges, amounting to several hundred kilograms of TNT.</p>
      
      <p>Composhield has developed and patented a unique solution for these applications: High Impact-Resistant Composite, or HIRC. These products are incredibly resistant to blast loads and can effectively safeguard permanent installations with minimal spatial footprint.</p>
      
      <p>The technology integrates a UHSS rebar pattern intertwined with high-strength aramid fibers embedded in a specialized cementitious matrix. This composition forms a panel that possesses exceptional strength, offering ductility that enables a HIRC panel to absorb vast amounts of energy without breaking apart or losing structural integrity.</p>
  
      <h2>Semi-Mobile: Sturdy and Reliable with SC Technology</h2>
      <p>Composhield's patented technology for semi-mobile applications is the Steel-Concrete composite, or SC. This system leverages a combination of HHA steel, HH steel, and a reinforced cementitious matrix to create an armor panel that offers:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent resistance to blast loading</li>
        <li>Ballistic protection up to STANAG 4569 Level 3</li>
        <li>Protection against fragmentation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The SC technology might be heavier compared to our mobile CP technology for the same threat level, but it provides superior protection at a more affordable cost. It's ideally suited for safeguarding larger structures where mass is not the most crucial factor.</p>
  
      <h2>Mobile: Exceptional Strength and Stiffness with CP Technology</h2>
      <p>Composhield's structural armor for mobile applications features high-strength and high-stiffness composite materials that incorporate ballistic properties. The armor component is derived from our Ceramic Polymer (CP) technology, widely used for add-on armor.</p>
      
      <p>In mobile applications, the CP armor is reconfigured to better carry and absorb structural loads, allowing the armor panels to be used as structural elements for sides, doors, hatches, etc., while still providing ballistic protection.</p> 
  
      <p>Key benefits include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ballistic performance up to STANAG 4569 Level 4</li>
        <li>Protection against fragments from mortars and artillery shells</li>
        <li>High structural stiffness and strength</li>
        <li>Excellent multi-hit capabilities</li>
        <li>Good resistance to blast loading</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>This design minimizes the overall mass of the armor system, eliminating material wastage on redundant system components. This makes the CP structural armor ideal for applications where mass and space are at a premium.</p>
