      <h1>Add-On Armor: Effective, Lightweight, and Customizable Protection for Vehicles</h1>
      <p>Add-on armor solutions serve as an effective means of enhancing the protection level of both existing and new vehicles. By leveraging advanced composite technology, the weight penalty traditionally associated with vehicle armor can be significantly reduced. This makes the implementation of high-level protection solutions feasible even for lighter vehicles, ensuring improved protection without compromising on mobility.</p>

      <p>Custom-designed to meet specific threat requirements, add-on armor systems take into account the type of materials used in the armor solution and any existing base armor, such as a steel or aluminum vehicle hull. This ensures that every armor solution provided by Composhield is uniquely tailored to the specific application and scenario.</p>
  
      <p>Composhield is committed to developing lightweight and durable armor solutions designed to combat the ballistic and IED threats faced on today's battlefield.</p>
  
      <h2>Ballistic Protection:</h2>
      <p>Ballistic threats from handguns, rifles, machine guns, etc., pose a constant risk to military vehicles. To maintain operational freedom in hostile environments, protection against different types of weapons and ammunition is vital.</p>
  
      <p>Composhield armor solutions can be tailored to meet any ballistic requirement and have been independently tested and certified to combat a wide range of threats, offering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protection in accordance with NATO STANAG 4569 Level 1 to 5</li>
        <li>Blast and fragment resistance</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Protected by patents, Composhield's ballistic armor has been specifically designed to ensure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High structural integrity and stiffness</li>
        <li>Superior multi-hit capability</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>These armor solutions can withstand multiple impacts from weapons fire, fragmentation, and blast without breaking up, leaving the vehicle unprotected. Additionally, Composhield armor solutions are resistant to high temperatures, chemical agents, and have a high degree of wear resistance.</p>
  
      <h2>IED Protection:</h2>
      <p>The threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) constitutes the most severe threat for many forces operating in today's conflict areas. IEDs come in many forms and can subject targets to both heavy blasts and severe fragmentation.</p>
  
      <p>Composhield armor solutions have been specifically designed to counter IED threats, providing high structural durability to withstand blasts and superior stopping capabilities to counter fragmentation. They have been tested to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop fragments with less than 1 meter stand-off</li>
        <li>Withstand 50+ kg of TNT at less than 3 meter stand-off</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Current scenarios also require protection against explosively formed projectiles (EFPs), which present an even more severe threat today. Composhield armor solutions are tested against such threats and can be customized to meet any requirement needed.</p>
