      <h1>Spall Liner: Advanced Protection for Vehicle Crew Compartments</h1>
      <h2>Spall Liner: The Defensive Advantage</h2>
        Spall liner, a crucial safety feature for armored vehicles, 
        provides an extra layer of protection within the crew compartment. 
        It is typically composed of pliant materials like aramid or glass fiber, 
        designed to shield occupants from dangerous fragments or 'spall' generated upon impact. 
        Not just an add-on, a spall liner can form an integral part of the armor system, 
        leveraging the fiber's exceptional energy-absorbing properties to amplify the vehicle's defensive capabilities. 
        Depending on the vehicle's structure and the protection required, two types of spall liners are commonly used:
         solid, pressed panels, and flexible blankets.

<h2>Panels: The Sturdy Defense Shield</h2>
Spall liner panels are a sturdy, reliable composite plate,
 solidified using a custom resin system tailored to meet 
 operational and environmental demands. This process gives
  the panels their rigid and robust characteristics, making
   them highly durable. Each spall liner panel comes with a
    rubber coating for environmental protection and a superior
     finish. They incorporate cut-outs for seamless mounting
      and packaging interfaces, and can even be preformed with
       bends to fit the vehicle perfectly. Panels are ideal for
        visible areas and spots with little to no support. They
         can be based on a variety of fiber types including aramid, glass,
          and polyethylene (HDPE).

<h2>Blankets: Adaptable Armor</h2>
Spall liner blankets offer a more adaptable alternative. These feature layers of unconsolidated fiber wrapped in a polymeric bag, providing robust protection against wear, moisture, dust, and UV-light. Spall liner blankets are customizable according to the level of protection needed. They can function as a standalone solution against smaller threats like hand grenades (e.g., DM-51 or M67), or be integrated as part of a comprehensive protection system against high-level IEDs and kinetic energy (KE) threats. These blankets can be produced in very large dimensions and tailored to shape, size, and includes cut-outs for mounting, packaging interfaces, etc., making them ideal for complex areas such as the vehicle's floor.
